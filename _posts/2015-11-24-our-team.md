Laura was licensed in 1989 and immediately decided to specialize in haircolor. With a great mentor, she found a love for Framesi hair color and took every class she could get her hands on. After working with the color line for several years, she decided to pursue her love of teaching and worked with Framesi for almost 10 years. 

Her experience includes working backstage with models at large shows, teaching in- salon classes, and participating on the Framesi Italian Style Cutting Team.
Laura delivers straightforward color and cuts that gives her client the ability to style at home and still look great. She is warm and genuine and takes pride in making all clients comfortable and taken care of.
